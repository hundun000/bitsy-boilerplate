### project idea

I like the game series *harvest moon(牧場物語)*. I have played the GB and GBA harvest moon games and other farming games such as *stardew valley*. I am impressed by the pixel worlds and enjoying the farming time. 

When I first met the bitsy engine, I writed the [harvest-mushroom](https://hundun.itch.io/harvest-mushroom), a simple game only has few mechanisms about farming. 

In the Low Code Game Jam, I plan make a farming game with some new features(purchasement, more interaction to fields, more area...). This project will focus on the features of what player can do in winter. As a longer-term paln(not during this jam), the completed farming game will has a season changing system. Some parts of this project is inherit from the harvest-mushroom project, or they may be replaced later.

### about low-code

On the bitsy built-in language scripts side. Some scripts' text are generated by my java program which can uniform the variables names through different sections, repeatly generate some similar sections from one template... These scripts can be writed in bity editer actually, so I consider that the java generator program's coding is not a part of the game project.

On the bitsy hacks scripts side. I use some published and custom hacks to implement something like iterate-loop-block, array-variable and keyboard-input, which are not supported in the original bitsy but commonly uesed in programing. These hacks and calling are codes but I think they are necessary.
